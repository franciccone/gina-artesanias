## Description

This is the first version of a fictional E-Commerce project for Gina Artesanías, a shop with hand-made products for babies and kids, as part of the Web Development project for [Coderhouse](https://www.coderhouse.es/).

It was my first Web Development project, where I learned how to use HTML5 and CSS3, plus SASS and Bootstrap.

You can see a better version, with JavaScript, [here](https://github.com/franciccone/gina-artesanias-js).

<b>Technologies used:</b>

HTML

CSS3

SASS

Bootstrap
